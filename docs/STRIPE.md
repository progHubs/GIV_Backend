# Stripe Payment Integration: Finished Tasks

## 1. `src/services/stripe.service.js`
- Implements the core integration with the Stripe API.
- Provides functions to create Stripe Checkout Sessions, retrieve sessions by ID, list sessions by subscription ID (for recurring payments), and construct/verify Stripe webhook events.
- Uses environment variables for Stripe secret and webhook keys.

## 2. `src/api/controllers/stripe.controller.js`
- Handles all HTTP requests related to Stripe payments.
- `createStripeSession`: Validates input, determines donation amount/tier, prepares session parameters (including metadata for campaign, donor, anonymity, and type), and creates a Stripe Checkout Session for one-time or recurring donations. Returns the session URL for frontend redirection.
- `stripeWebhook`: Handles Stripe webhook events for payment success (one-time and recurring), verifies event signatures, extracts metadata, and calls the donation service to process successful payments, update stats, and send receipts. Handles idempotency and error logging.

## 3. `src/api/routes/stripe.routes.js`
- Defines all Stripe-related API routes.
- Includes a webhook endpoint (`/webhook`) that uses `express.raw` for signature verification, and a session creation endpoint (`/session`) for initiating Stripe Checkout Sessions.
- Integrates with the Stripe controller for all logic.

## 4. `src/api/utils/stripeTiers.js`
- Defines real Stripe Product and Price IDs for monthly recurring donation tiers (bronze, silver, gold).
- Provides helper functions to get tier amounts and price IDs for use in session creation.

## 5. `src/services/donation.service.js` (integration)
- Handles successful Stripe donations (from webhooks), including idempotency, updating donor and campaign stats, and sending donation receipt emails.
- Supports both one-time and recurring (subscription) donations.

## 6. `src/api/controllers/donation.controller.js` (integration)
- Supports donation creation via Stripe by integrating with the Stripe session creation and webhook flows.

## 7. `src/server.js` (integration)
- Mounts the Stripe routes under `/payments/stripe`.
- Provides frontend success/cancel pages for Stripe payment completion.

## 8. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma` and `prisma/schema.sql`)
- Supports storing Stripe transaction IDs, payment status, receipt URLs, and all relevant metadata for donations.

---

**All major Stripe payment flows (session creation, one-time/recurring, webhook handling, metadata, donation integration, email receipts, and admin controls) are fully implemented with robust validation, security, and user feedback.**
