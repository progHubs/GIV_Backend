# Donation Management: Finished Tasks

## 1. `src/api/controllers/donation.controller.js`
- Implements the donation controller for all donation-related HTTP requests.
- Handles creating new donations (anonymous or authenticated), listing/filtering donations (admin sees all, donors see their own), retrieving a single donation by ID (with access control), getting donation statistics (admin), updating donation status (admin), and deleting donations (admin).
- Integrates with the donation service for business logic and enforces permissions for sensitive actions.
- Handles error responses and status codes for all donation flows.

## 2. `src/services/donation.service.js`
- Implements the donation service for all donation-related business logic.
- Handles creating new donations (anonymous or authenticated), including donor profile creation for new donors, updating donor and campaign statistics, and sending donation receipt emails (if not anonymous).
- Handles listing/filtering donations (admin sees all, donors see their own), retrieving a single donation by ID (with access control), getting donation statistics (totals, completed, etc.), updating donation status (admin), and deleting donations (admin).
- Handles Stripe donation success webhooks, including idempotency, updating stats, and sending receipts.
- Integrates with Prisma ORM for database operations and provides detailed error handling and logging.

## 3. `src/api/routes/donation.routes.js`
- Defines all donation-related API routes.
- Includes routes for creating donations (public, anonymous or authenticated), listing/filtering donations (authenticated), retrieving a single donation by ID (authenticated), getting donation statistics (admin), updating donation status (admin), and deleting donations (admin).
- Applies authentication, admin checks, and rate limiting as appropriate.
- Implements an `optionalAuthenticateToken` middleware to allow both anonymous and authenticated donations.

## 4. `src/api/validators/donation.validator.js`
- Implements input validation for all donation-related endpoints using Joi.
- Validates donation creation, donation status updates, and donation query/filter parameters.
- Enforces constraints on donor/campaign IDs, amount, currency, donation type, payment method/status, transaction/receipt, anonymity, and notes.
- Provides validation functions for donation creation, update, and query.

## 5. `src/services/email.service.js` (integration)
- Sends donation receipt emails to donors (if not anonymous) after successful donation creation or Stripe webhook processing.
- Loads and renders the donation receipt email template, logs all sent emails, and handles errors robustly.

## 6. `src/api/controllers/stripe.controller.js` (integration)
- Handles Stripe webhook events for donation payments, including one-time and recurring donations.
- Calls the donation service to process successful payments, update stats, and send receipts.

## 7. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma` and `prisma/schema.sql`)
- Defines the `donations` table/model with all relevant fields (donor, campaign, amount, type, payment, status, transaction, receipt, anonymity, timestamps, etc.).
- Enforces foreign key relationships to donor profiles and campaigns, and indexes for efficient queries.

---

**All major donation management flows (creation, anonymous/authenticated, filtering, statistics, Stripe integration, email receipts, validation, and admin controls) are fully implemented with robust validation, security, and user feedback.**
