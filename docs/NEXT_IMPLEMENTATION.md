## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

**Start with Campaign Management** as it's the core fundraising functionality that will enable the organization to generate revenue and track donations effectively. This should be followed by Event Management to engage volunteers and donors.

The current implementation is solid and follows the project plan well. You're on track with the timeline, having completed the foundational authentication and user management systems. The next phase should focus on the core business functionality (campaigns, events, donations) before moving to content management and analytics.
